# Tailwind CSS Playground & Template Library

This repository is a **personal Tailwind CSS learning playground** and **template reference library**.

The goal of this project is to:
- Learn Tailwind CSS through hands-on styling
- Build reusable UI templates (cards, layouts, forms, etc.)
- Maintain a central place to experiment with general styles
- Easily reuse templates in future projects (Laravel, plain HTML, or others)

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

Instead of learning Tailwind purely through documentation or courses, this repo focuses on:

- **Learning by building**
- **Understanding layout, spacing, and sizing**
- **Practicing Tailwind’s utility-first mindset**
- **Creating reusable reference templates**

This is **not** a production-ready project.  
It is intentionally simple and focused on styling.
